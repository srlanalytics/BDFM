## Description

bdfm estimates dynamic factor models by simulation using the Durbin and Koopman (2012) disturbance smoother and returns estimated factors, predicted values of observables, posterior distributions for predicted values (optional), and forecast updates by series (optional). Maximum likelihood estimation via Watson and Engle (1983) and "2-step" estimation via principal components is also supported. Input data may be mixed frequency, noisy, have missing values, or "ragged edges" due to different start or end dates.

## Installation

```t
remotes::install_github("srlanalytics/bdfm")
```

## Basic Use

Estimate a model with two factors and two lags in the transition equation
```r
library(bdfm)
Est <- dfm(Y = data, factors = 2, lags = 2)
```
Input data is any data type that can be coverted by ```as.matrix() ``` and should index time in rows and series in columns. If the library [tsbox](https://github.com/christophsax/tsbox) is present time seires attributes of input data are preserved for any `ts_boxable()` data format. In this case data need not be entered in tabular format for types such as `data.table` or `data.frame`.

Quick time series plot estimated factors
```r
ts.plot(Est$factors)
```
Quick time series plot of fitted values (including forecasts and nowcasts) for first series in input data
```r
ts.plot(Est$values[,1])
```

## Full Input

```r
Est <- dfm(Y, factors = 1, lags = 2, forecast = 0,
                method = c("bayesian", "ml", "pc"),
                frequency_mix = NULL, differences = NULL,
                B_prior = NULL, lam_B = 0, H_prior = NULL, lam_H = 0, nu_q = 0,
                nu_r = NULL, identification = "PC_full", intercept = TRUE,
                store_idx = NULL, reps = 1000, burn = 500, loud = FALSE,
                EM_tolerance = 0.01)
```
